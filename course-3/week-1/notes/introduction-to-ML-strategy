-- Why ML Strategy --

Why do we need ML strategy?
	Because there are too many options to improve an algorithm
		And if one chooses poorly, time will be wasted
	@Therefore we need a way of methodically narrowing the choices

=====================================================================================
-- Orthogonalization --

Orthogonalization means that something was designed such that every input affects only one aspect
	@More specifically: differentiate each dimension to a single input
	This makes it easier, simpler, and more intuitive for others to achieve a desired effect

!Tune the inputs of a machine learning system so that:
	Fit training set well on cost function
		Bigger network
		Adam/optimizt  	
		...
	Fit dev set well on cost function
		Regularization
		Bigger training set
	Fit test set well on cost function
		Bigger dev set
	Performs well in real world
		Change devset or cost function

*A lot of people use early stopping, Andrew doesn't like it
	Because it's a weird technique to think about
	@Affects both fitting to training set and dev set 
		@Not orthogonalized!
		(fits one better at the cost of the other)
